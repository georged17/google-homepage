# google-homepage
A clone of the Google homepage for an assignment on the Odin Project

This Google homepage clone is supposed to help me test my knowledge of the HTML and CSS learned so far. I suspect I will be using Flexbox for layout beside the basics.

This project will be improved upon countinuously while I keep on learning new skills.
